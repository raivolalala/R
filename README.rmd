# Personal R scripts
* **database scanner** (for now)
* **README file**

Note that all scripts published here are made by a complete noob. My main idea behind all this is to practice R, learn some new stuff and eventually I might be able to publish something of an actual value.

*All users of Brave browser are able to chip in some BAT!* ;)
